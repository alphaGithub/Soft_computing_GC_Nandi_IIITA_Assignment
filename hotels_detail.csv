I believe any Hostel or Hotel will not charge you for a cup of hot water.
Rest, Location is good, Peacefull area, tram station is 1 min walk away.",The stay was good. Everything was very fine and up to the mark. Nice and very cooperative staff. Food services were good. The nice garden area was available there. Location wise it was nice.
